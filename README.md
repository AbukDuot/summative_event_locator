# Event Locator Application

The **Event Locator Application** is a multi-user backend application built with Node.js. It allows users to discover events based on their location and preferences. The application supports multilingual functionality, geospatial data handling, and asynchronous notifications, making it a robust and scalable solution for event management.

## Features

### Core Features
- **User Management**: Secure user registration and login with password hashing.
- **Event Management**: Create, read, update, and delete events with geospatial data (latitude/longitude).
- **Location-Based Search**: Search for events within a specified radius of the user's location.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter events based on categories.
- **Multilingual Support (i18n)**: Support for multiple languages in the user interface.
- **Notification System**: Asynchronous notifications for upcoming events using a message queue.

### Additional Features
- **Event Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate and review events.
- **Favorites**: Users can save events to their favorites list.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Real-time updates for event changes using WebSockets.
- **Mapping Integration**: Display event locations on a map using Google Maps API.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data handling
- **Authentication**: bcrypt for password hashing, Passport.js for authentication
- **Message Queue**: Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ for asynchronous notifications
- **Internationalization**: i18next for multilingual support
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **Geospatial Libraries**: PostGIS functions for geospatial queries

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Redis or RabbitMQ (for notifications)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-locator.git
   cd event-locator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
 ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
   Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following:
 ```env
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/event_locator
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Set up the database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and enable the PostGIS extension.
   - Run the migrations to set up the schema:
   ```bash
  npm run migrate
     ```

5. Start the application:
